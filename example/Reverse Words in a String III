Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Example 1:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        ii = s.split(" ")
        count = 0
        for i in ii:
            ii[count] = (i[::-1])
            count += 1
        string = " ".join(ii)
        return (string)
